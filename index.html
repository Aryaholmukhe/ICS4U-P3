      <strong>Binary Search:</strong> Efficient for sorted lists; halves the search space with each step. Best case: target is at the middle. Worst case: logarithmic steps are needed.<br>
      <strong>Linear Search:</strong> Works on unsorted lists. Best case: target is the first element. Worst case: must traverse the entire list.
